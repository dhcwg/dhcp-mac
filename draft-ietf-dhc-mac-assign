    <!--  SECTION 0:  Abstract                      -->

    <abstract>
      <t>In certain environments, e.g., large scale virtualization
      deployments, new devices are created in an automated manner. Such
      devices may have their link-layer addresses assigned in an automated
      fashion. With sufficient scale, the likelihood of a collision using
      random assignment without duplication detection is not acceptable.
      Therefore an allocation mechanism is required. This draft proposes
      an extension to DHCPv6 that allows a scalable approach to link-layer
      address assignments
      where preassigned link-layer address assignments (such as by a
      manufacturer) are not possible or unnecessary.</t>

    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <!-- 1, line 230-->

      <t>There are several deployment types that deal with a large number
      of devices that need to be initialized. One of them is a scenario
      where virtual machines (VMs) are created on a massive scale.
      Typically the new VM instances are assigned a link-layer address,
      but random assignment does not scale well due to the risk of
      a collision (see Appendix A.1 of <xref target="RFC4429"/>). Another
      use case is IoT (Internet of Things) devices (see
      <xref target="RFC7228"/>). The huge number of such devices could
      strain the IEEE's available OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)
      global address space. While there is typically no need to provide
      global link-layer address uniqueness for such devices, a link-layer
      assignment mechanism allows for conflicts to be avoided
      inside an administrative domain. For those reasons, it is desired to
      have some form of mechanism that would be able to assign locally
      unique MAC (media access control) addresses.</t>
      
      <t>This document proposes a new mechanism that extends DHCPv6
      operation to handle link-layer address assignments.</t>

      <t>Since DHCPv6 (<xref target="RFC8415"/>) is a protocol
      that can allocate various types of resources (non-temporary
      addresses, temporary addresses, prefixes, as well as many options)
      and has the necessary infrastructure to maintain such allocations
      (numerous server and client implementations, large deployed
      relay infrastructure, and supportive solutions such as leasequery
      and failover), it is a good candidate to address the desired
      functionality.</t>
      
      <t>While this document presents a design that should be usable for
      any link-layer address type, some of the details are specific to
      IEEE 802 48-bit MAC addresses <xref target="IEEEStd802"/>. Future
      documents may provide specifics for other link-layer address
      types.</t>

      <t>IEEE 802 originally set aside half of the 48-bit MAC address
      space for local use (where the U/L bit is set to 1). In 2017,
      IEEE published an amendment <xref target="IEEEStd802c"/> that
      divides this space into quadrants with differentied address rules.
      More details are in <xref target="IEEE802cSummary"/>.</t>
      
      <t>IEEE is also developing protocols and procedures for
      assignment of locally unique addresses (IEEE 802.1CQ). This work may
      serve as an alternative protocol for assignment. For additional
      background, see <xref target="IEEE-P802.1CQ-Project"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="overview" title="Deployment scenarios and mechanism overview">

      <t>This mechanism is designed to be generic and usable in many
      deployments, but there are two scenarios it attempts to address in
      particular: (i) proxy client mode, and (ii) direct client mode.</t>

      <section anchor="proxy" title="Proxy client mode scenario">

        <t>This mode is used when an entity acts as a DHCP client and requests
        available DHCP servers to assign one or more addresses (an address block),
        to be then assigned for use by the final end-devices. Large-scale
        virtualization is one application scenario for proxy client mode. In such
        environments this entity is often called a hypervisor and is frequently
        required to spawn new VMs. The hypervisor needs to assign new addresses to
        those machines. The hypervisor does not use those addresses for itself, but
        rather uses them to create new VMs with appropriate addresses. It is
        worth pointing out the cumulative nature of this scenario. Over time, the
        hypervisor is likely to increase its address usage. Some obsolete VMs
        will be deleted and their addresses are potentially eligible for reuse for new VMs.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="direct" title="Direct client mode scenario">

        <t>This mode can be used when an entity acts as a DHCP client and
        requests available DHCP servers to assign one or more addresses
        (an address block) for its use. This usage scenario is related to
        IoT, as described earlier (see <xref target="intro"/>). Upon first
        boot, for each interface the device uses a temporary address, as
        described in <xref target="IEEEStd802.11"/> or to be described in
        IEEE 802.1CQ <xref target="IEEE-P802.1CQ-Project"/>, to send
        initial DHCP packets to available DHCP servers wherein the device
        requests a single address for that network interface. Once the
        server assigns an address, the device abandons its
        temporary address and uses the assigned (leased) address.</t>
        
        <t>Note that a client that operates as above that does not have a
        globally unique link-layer address on any of its interfaces MUST
        NOT use a link-layer based DUID (DHCP Unique Identifier). For more
        details, refer to Section 11 of <xref target="RFC8415"/>.</t>

        <t>Also, a client that operates as above may run into issues if
        the switch it is connected to prohibits or restricts link-layer
        address changes. This may limit where this capability can be used,
        or may require the administrator to adjust the configuration of
        the switch(es) to allow a change in address.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="mechanism" title="Mechanism Overview">

        <t>In all scenarios the protocol operates in fundamentally the
        same way. The device requesting an address, acting as a DHCP
        client, will send a Solicit message with a IA_LL option to all
        available DHCP servers. That IA_LL option MUST include a LLADDR
        option specifying the link-layer-type and
        link-layer-len and may include a specific address or address
        block as a hint for the server. Each available server responds
        with either a Reply message with committed address(es) (if Rapid
        Commit was requested and honored) or an Advertise message with
        offered address(es). The client selects a server's response as
        governed by <xref target="RFC8415"/>. If necessary, the client
        sends a Request message and the target server will then assign the
        address(es) and send a Reply message. Once a Reply is received,
        the client can start using those address(es).</t>

        <t>Normal DHCP mechanisms are in use. The client is expected to
        periodically renew the addresses as governed by T1 and T2 timers
        and stop using the address once the valid lifetime expires.
        Renewals can be administratively disabled by the server
        sending "infinity" as the T1 and T2 values (see Section 7.7 of
        <xref target="RFC8415"/>). An administrator may make the address
        assignment permanent by specifying use of the "infinity" valid
        lifetime, as defined in Section 7.7 of
        <xref target="RFC8415"/>.</t>

        <t>The client can release addresses when they are no longer
        needed by sending a Release message (see Section 18.2.7
        of <xref target="RFC8415"/>).</t>

        <t>Figure 9 in <xref target="RFC8415"/> shows
        a timeline diagram of the messages exchanged between a client and
        two servers for the typical lifecycle of one or more leases.</t>

        <t>Confirm and Information-Request messages are not used in
        link-layer address assignment. Decline should technically
        never be needed, but see <xref target="selecting-addresses"/> for
        one situation where this message is needed.</t>

        <t>Clients implementing this mechanism SHOULD use the Rapid Commit
        option as specified in Section 5.1 and 18.2.1 of
        <xref target="RFC8415"/> to obtain addresses with a 2-message
        exchange when possible.</t>

        <t>Devices supporting this proposal MAY support the reconfigure
        mechanism, as defined in Section 18.2.11 of
        <xref target="RFC8415"/>. If supported by both server and client,
        the reconfigure mechanism allows the administrator to immediately
        notify clients that the configuration has changed and triggers
        retrieval of relevant changes immediately, rather than after the
        T1 timer elapses. Since this mechanism requires implementation of
        Reconfigure Key Authentication Protocol (See Section 20.4 of
        <xref target="RFC8415"/>), small-footprint devices may choose to
        not support it.</t>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Design Assumptions">
      <t>One of the essential aspects of this mechanism is its cumulative
      nature, especially in the hypervisor scenario. The server-client
      relationship does not look like other DHCP transactions in the
      hypervisor scenario. In a typical environment, there would be one
      server and a rather small number of hypervisors, possibly
      even only one. However, over time the number of addresses requested
      by the hypervisor(s) will increase as more VMs are spawned.</t>

      <t>Another aspect crucial for efficient design is the observation
      that a single client acting as hypervisor will likely use thousands
      of addresses. An approach similar to what is used for IPv6
      address or prefix assignment (IA container with all assigned
      addresses listed, one option for each address) would not work well.
      Therefore the mechanism should operate on address blocks, rather
      than single values. A single address can be treated as an address
      block with just one address.</t>

      <t>The DHCP mechanisms are reused to large degree, including message
      and option formats, transmission mechanisms, relay infrastructure
      and others. However, a device wishing to support only link-layer
      address assignment is not required to support full DHCP. In other
      words, the device may support only assignment of link-layer
      addresses, but not IPv6 addresses or prefixes.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Information-Encoding" title="Information Encoding">
      <t>A client MUST send a LLADDR option encapsulated in an IA_LL
      option to specify the link-layer-type and link-layer-len values. For
      link-layer-type 1 (Ethernet) and 6 (IEEE 802 Networks), a client
      sets the link-layer-address field to:
        
      <list hangIndent="4" style="hanging">
        <t hangText="1.">All zeroes if the client has
          no hint as to the starting address of the unicast address block.
          This address has the IEEE 802 individual/group bit set to 0
          (individual).
        </t>

        <t hangText="2.">Any other value to request a specific block of
          address starting with the specified address<!-- (this may be a
          unicast or multicast address).-->
        </t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>Encoding information for other link-layer-types may be added in
      the future by publishing an RFC that specifies those values.</t>

      <t>A client sets the extra-addresses field to either 0 for a single
      address or the size of the requested address block minus 1.</t>

      <t>A client MUST set the valid-lifetime field to 0 (this field
      MUST be ignored by the server).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requesting Addresses">
      <t>The addresses are assigned in blocks. The smallest block is a
      single address. To request an assignment, the client sends a Solicit
      message with an IA_LL option in the message. The IA_LL option MUST
      contain a LLADDR option as specified in
      <xref target="Information-Encoding"/>.</t>

      <t>The server, upon receiving an IA_LL option, inspects its content
      and may offer an address or addresses for each LLADDR option
      according to its policy. The server MAY take into consideration the
      address block requested by the client in the LLADDR option. However,
      the server MAY choose to ignore some or all parameters of the
      requested address block. In particular, the server may send a
      different starting address than requested, or a smaller number of
      addresses than requested. The server sends back an Advertise
      message with an IA_LL option containing an LLADDR option that
      specifies the addresses being offered. If the server is unable to 
      provide any addresses it MUST return the IA_LL option containing a
      Status Code option (see Section 21.13 of <xref target="RFC8415"/>)
      with status set to NoAddrsAvail.</t>

      <t>Note: Servers that do not support the IA_LL option will ignore
      the option and not return it in Advertise (and Reply) messages.
      Clients that send IA_LL options MUST treat this as if the server
      returned the NoAddrsAvail status for these IA_LL option(s).
      </t>

      <t>The client waits for available servers to send Advertise
      responses and picks one server as defined in Section 18.2.9 of
      <xref target="RFC8415"/>. The client then sends a Request
      message that includes the IA_LL container option with the LLADDR
      option copied from the Advertise message sent by the chosen
      server.</t>

      <t>The client MUST process the address block(s) returned in the
      Advertise, rather than what it included in the Solicit, and may 
      consider the offered address block(s) in selecting the Advertise to
      accept. The server may offer a smaller number of addresses or
      different addresses from those requested. A client MUST NOT use
      resources returned in an Advertise message except to select a server
      and in sending the Request to that server; resources are only
      useable by a client when returned in a Reply message.</t>

      <t>Upon reception of a Request message with IA_LL container option,
      the server assigns the requested addresses. The server allocates a
      block of addresses according to its configured policy. The server
      MAY assign a different block or smaller block size than requested in
      the Request message. The server then generates and sends a Reply
      message back to the client.</t>

      <t>Upon receiving a Reply message, the client parses the IA_LL
      container option and may start using all provided addresses. It MUST 
      restart its T1 and T2 timers using the values specified in the IA_LL
      option.</t>

      <t>The client MUST use the address block(s) returned in the Reply
      message, which may be smaller block(s) or with different address(es)
      than requested.</t>      

      <t>A client that has included a Rapid Commit option in the Solicit
      may receive a Reply in response to the Solicit and skip the
      Advertise and Request steps above (see Section 18.2.1 of
      <xref target="RFC8415"/>).</t>
      
      <t>A client that changes its link-layer address on an interface
      SHOULD follow the recommendations in Section 7.2.6 of
      <xref target="RFC4861"/> to inform its neighbors of the new
      link-layer address quickly.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Renewing Addresses">

      <t>Address renewals follow the normal DHCP renewals processing
      described in Section 18.2.4 of <xref target="RFC8415"/>. Once the T1
      timer elapses, the client starts sending Renew messages with the
      IA_LL option containing a LLADDR option for the address block being
      renewed. The server responds with a Reply message that contains the
      renewed address block. The server MUST NOT shrink or expand the
      address block. Once a block is assigned and has a non-zero valid
      lifetime, its size, starting address, and ending address MUST NOT
      change.</t>

      <t>If the requesting client needs additional addresses -- e.g., in
      the hypervisor scenario because addresses need to be assigned to new
      VMs -- it MUST send an IA_LL option with a different IAID to create
      another "container" for more addresses.</t>

      <t>If the client is unable to Renew before the T2 timer elapses, it
      starts sending Rebind messages as described in Section 18.2.5 of
      <xref target="RFC8415"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Releasing Addresses">

      <t>The client may decide to release a leased address block. A client
      MUST release the whole block in its entirety. A client releases an
      address block by sending a Release message that includes an IA_LL
      option containing the LLADDR option for the address block to
      release. The Release transmission mechanism is described in Section
      18.2.7 of <xref target="RFC8415"/>.</t>

      <t>Note: If the client is releasing the link-layer address it is
      using, it MUST stop using this address before sending the
      Release message (as per <xref target="RFC8415"/>). In order to send
      the Release message, the client MUST use another address (such as
      the one originally used to initiate DHCPv6 to provide an allocated
      link-layer address).</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="option" title="Option Definitions">

      <t>This mechanism uses an approach similar to the existing
      mechanisms in DHCP. There is one container option (the IA_LL option)
      that contains the actual address or addresses, represented by an
      LLADDR option. Each LLADDR option represents an address block, which
      is expressed as a first address with a number that specifies how
      many additional addresses are included.</t>

        <t>An IA_LL option may only appear in the options area of a DHCP
        message.  A DHCP message may contain multiple IA_LL options
        (though each must have a unique IAID).</t>

        <t>The status of any operations involving this IA_LL is indicated
        in a Status Code option (see Section 21.13 of
        <xref target="RFC8415"/>) in the IA_LL-options field.
        </t>

        <t>Note that an IA_LL has no explicit "lifetime" or "lease length"
        of its own. When the valid lifetimes of all of the addresses in an
        IA_LL have expired, the IA_LL can be considered as having expired.
        T1 and T2 are included to give servers explicit control over when
        a client recontacts the server about a specific IA_LL.</t>

        <t>In a message sent by a client to a server, the T1 and T2 fields
        MUST be set to 0.  The server MUST ignore any values in these
        fields in messages received from a client.</t>

        <t>In a message sent by a server to a client, the client MUST use
        the values in the T1 and T2 fields for the T1 and T2 times, unless
        those values in those fields are 0.  The values in the T1 and T2
        fields are the number of seconds until T1 and T2.</t>

        <t>As per Section 7.7 of <xref target="RFC8415"/>),
        the value 0xffffffff is taken to mean "infinity" and should be
        used carefully.</t>

        <t>The server selects the T1 and T2 times to allow the client to
        extend the lifetimes of any address block in the IA_LL before the
        lifetimes expire, even if the server is unavailable for some short
        period of time.  Recommended values for T1 and T2 are .5 and .8
        times the shortest valid lifetime of the address blocks in the IA
        that the server is willing to extend, respectively.  If the
        "shortest" valid lifetime is 0xffffffff ("infinity"), the
        recommended T1 and T2 values are also 0xffffffff.  If the time at
        which the addresses in an IA_LL are to be renewed is to be left to
        the discretion of the client, the server sets T1 and T2 to 0.  The
        client MUST follow the rules defined in Section 14.2 in
        <xref target="RFC8415"/>.
        </t>

        <t>If a client receives an IA_LL with T1 greater than T2, and both
        T1 and T2 are greater than 0, the client discards the IA_LL option
        and processes the remainder of the message as though the server
        had not included the invalid IA_LL option.</t>

        <t>The IA_LL-options field typically contains one or more LLADDR
        options (see <xref target="LLADDR"/>). If a client does not include
        a LLADDR option in a Solicit or Request message, the server MUST
        treat this as a request for a single address and that the
        client has no hint as to the address it would like.</t>

      <xref target="RFC7227"/> for
      the DHCP security considerations. See <xref target="RFC8200"/>
      for the IPv6 security considerations.</t>

      <t>As discussed in Section 22 of <xref target="RFC8415"/>, "DHCP
      lacks end-to-end encryption between clients and servers; thus,
      hijacking, tampering, and eavesdropping attacks are all possible as
      a result." In some network environments, it is possible to secure
      them as discussed later in that Section 22.</t>
        
      <t>There is a possibility of the same link-layer address being
      used by more than one device if not all parties on a link use
      this mechanism to obtain an address from the space assigned to
      the DHCP server. Note that this issue would exist on these networks
      even if DHCP were not used to obtain the address.</t>

      <t>Server implementations SHOULD consider configuration options to
      limit the maximum number of addresses to allocate (both in a single
      request and in total) to a client. However, note that this does not
      prevent a bad client actor from pretending to be many different
      clients and consuming all available addresses.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
      
      <t>See Section 23 of <xref target="RFC8415"/> for the DHCP
      privacy considerations.</t>
      
      <t>For a client requesting a link-layer address directly from
      a server, as the address assigned to a client will
      likely be used by the client to communicate on the link, the
      address will be exposed to those able to listen in on this
      communication. For those peers on the link that are able to
      listen in on the DHCP exchange, they would also be able to
      correlate the client's identity (based on the DUID used) with the
      assigned address. Additional mechanisms, such as the ones described
      in <xref target="RFC7844"/> can also be used to improve
      anonymity by minimizing what is exposed.</t>

      <t>As discussed in Section 23 of <xref target="RFC8415"/>, DHCP
      servers and hypervisors may need to consider the implications of
      assigning addresses sequentially. Though in general, this is only
      of link-local concern unlike for IPv6 address assignment and
      prefix delegation as these may be used for communication over the
      Internet.</t>

      <t>This appendix provides a brief summary of IEEE 802c
           <xref target="IEEEStd802c"/>.</t>

      <t>The original IEEE 802 specifications assigned half of the 48-bit
      MAC address space to local use -- these addresses have the U/L bit
      set to 1 and are locally administered with no imposed structure.</t>

      <t>In 2017, the IEEE issued the IEEE Std 802c specification which
      defines a new optional "Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP) that
      specifies different assignment approaches in four specified regions
      of the local MAC address space." Under this plan, there are 4 SLAP
      quadrants that use different assignment policies.</t>

      <t>The first octet of the MAC address Z and Y bits define the
      quadrant for locally assigned addresses (X-bit is 1). In IEEE
      representation, these bits are as follows:</t>

      <t>The SLAP quadrants are:</t>

</texttable>

      <t>Extended Local Identifier (ELI) derived MAC addresses are based
      on an assigned Company ID (CID), which is 24-bits (including the M,
      X, Y, and Z bits) for 48-bit MAC addresses. This leaves 24-bits for
      the locally assigned address for each CID for unicast (M-bit = 0)
      and also for multicast (M-bit = 1). The CID is assigned by the IEEE
      RA.</t>

      <t>Standard Assigned Identifier (SAI) derived MAC addresses are
      assigned by a protocol specified in an IEEE 802 standard. For
      48-bit MAC addresses, 44 bits are available. Multiple protocols
      for assigning SAIs may be specified in IEEE standards. Coexistence
      of multiple protocols may be supported by limiting the subspace
      available for assignment by each protocol.</t>

      <t>Administratively Assigned Identifier (AAI) derived MAC addresses
      are assigned locally. Administrators manage the space as needed.
      Note that multicast IPv6 packets (<xref target="RFC2464"/>) use a
      destination address starting in 33-33, so AAI addresses in that
      range should not be assigned. For 48-bit MAC addresses, 44 bits are
      available.</t>

      <t>The last quadrant is reserved for future use. While this quadrant
      may also be used similar to AAI space, administrators should be
      aware that future specifications may define alternate uses that
      could be incompatible.</t>
